"""Q1: the per-site quantiser vectors an artifact carries, and where they come from.

The backend does not choose these numbers. The analyser measures them on the net being served
(`TASK_analyser_smoothquant_ptq_read_512_then_bt6test_0921.md`) and delivers one `.npz`; this module is
the only place that reads it, so the two lanes cannot drift on what a key means.

What a vector is
----------------
Per quantised site, over its INPUT channel axis:

    s_j = amax_j(x)^a / max_k |W[k, j]|^(1 - a)     the SmoothQuant migration, `a` the analyser's choice
    D   = max_j (amax_j / s_j) / 127                the ONE activation step the integer GEMM sees
    r_j = 1 / (s_j * D)                             what the artifact carries
    m_j                                             optional: the calibration mean, if the offset folds

and the conversion is `q_j = clamp(floor((x_j - m_j) * r_j + 0.5), -127, 127)`, with `W[:, j] * s_j`
quantised per output channel offline and `W . m` added to the GEMM bias offline. Only `r` and `m` are
served; `s`, `D` and `a` are the analyser's working, kept in the file for provenance and checked for
consistency when they are present.

⛔ `r` is NOT `1 / D`. A scalar step is the special case `s = 1`, which is what an unsmoothed site gets,
and what a PRE-norm net gets once the fold moves into the norm -- `identity_prescale` writes exactly that.
The flagship is post-norm, so the general case is the one that is built.

The file
--------
A `.npz` of 1-D float arrays, one per key:

    <site>/r     required, positive, finite, one entry per input channel
    <site>/m     optional, finite, the same length
    <site>/s     optional, provenance; if present, `r * s` must be constant over j to 1e-4 (that constant
                 is 1 / D, and a mismatch means the two were computed against different steps)
    <site>/amax  optional, provenance only

`<site>` is `encoder<index>/<name>` with `<name>` one of the four quantised sites, or `embedding/<name>`.
Anything else is refused: an unread key is a vector that was measured and then silently not served.
`producing_norm` maps a key to the norm whose artifact buffers (`_names.quant_names`) carry it.

This module is numpy-free on purpose -- no venv on the serving fleet carries numpy, and `lab/_onnx.py`
already decodes raw tensors by hand. The reader takes `.npy` v1/v2 members of a zip, little-endian
float16 / float32 / float64, C order, one dimension.
