"""Recover the lab net's architecture and weight names from its own graph.

The lab's exporter names every initializer `const_<n>` in first-use order, so
the names carry no meaning and cannot be mapped by a table -- a table would also
silently rot the first time an arm reorders an operation. What the graph does
carry is structure, and the structure is rigid: fifteen identical encoder blocks
around fifteen `Softmax` nodes, each with the same operator sequence.

So this module matches on the structure and reads the names off the matched
nodes. Every block must produce the same shapes as every other block, and that
agreement is asserted rather than assumed: a mapping that is wrong for one block
is wrong for all fifteen and will not survive the check.

⚠ The FFN gate is the reason the checking matters (round 17, AC-2). The lab's
`ACTIVATION_SWIGLU` enum selects Dauphin's **sigmoid** GLU, not SiLU, and the
only place that is unambiguous is the artifact: this recovery reads the gate
from the `Sigmoid` node it actually finds, and refuses a graph whose gate is
some other activation rather than guessing.
